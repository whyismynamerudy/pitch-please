    "transcript": "User: Uh, hi. So, um, our project is called BudgetHelper, or something like that. It's, uh, kind of like a budgeting app for, you know, students or anyone, really. We thought it would be cool to, like, help people manage their money better.\n\nSo, um, it\u2019s pretty simple. You put in, like, your expenses and your income, and it, uh, shows you\u2026 I guess, where your money is going? Uh, yeah, it\u2019s like\u2026 a pie chart or something. And we also, uh, want to add some AI, but we didn\u2019t really have time to figure that part out, so\u2026 yeah.\n\nWe used\u2026 some tools for it. Like, um, React for the front end and\u2026 uh, Flask? Yeah, Flask for the back end. Uh, it doesn\u2019t really work right now because, uh, we had some issues connecting the database. But, like, if it worked, it would probably be pretty helpful.\n\nWe think it\u2019s a great idea because, you know, people need help managing their money. And students are\u2026 broke? Yeah, so, uh, it\u2019s like a way to fix that. Um, we don\u2019t really have a demo right now, but, uh, we can show you the code if you want. Thanks.\n\nJudge 1: Thank you. Can you explain what makes your app different from existing budgeting tools?\n\nUser: Uh, well\u2026 it\u2019s for students? And, um, it has AI, I think. Or it will, when we add that part.\n\nJudge 2: How does your app ensure data security for users?\n\nUser: Oh, uh, good question. We didn\u2019t really get to that part yet. But, like, we would probably add some encryption or something later on. Yeah.\n\nJudge 1: What specific challenges did your team face, and how did you solve them?\n\nUser: Oh, uh, a lot of stuff didn\u2019t work. Like, the database connection was a problem, and we tried Googling it, but we didn\u2019t really have time to fix it. So, yeah, we just kind of left it for now.\n\nJudge 2: Do you have a plan for monetization?\n\nUser: Uh\u2026 not really. We\u2019re still figuring that out. Maybe ads or something?\n\nJudge 1: Alright, thank you for sharing.\n\nUser: Uh, yeah, thanks. Sorry it\u2019s not, like, done or anything.",
