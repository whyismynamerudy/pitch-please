User: Uh, hi. So, um, our project is called BudgetHelper, or something like that. It's, uh, kind of like a budgeting app for, you know, students or anyone, really. We thought it would be cool to, like, help people manage their money better.

So, um, it’s pretty simple. You put in, like, your expenses and your income, and it, uh, shows you… I guess, where your money is going? Uh, yeah, it’s like… a pie chart or something. And we also, uh, want to add some AI, but we didn’t really have time to figure that part out, so… yeah.

We used… some tools for it. Like, um, React for the front end and… uh, Flask? Yeah, Flask for the back end. Uh, it doesn’t really work right now because, uh, we had some issues connecting the database. But, like, if it worked, it would probably be pretty helpful.

We think it’s a great idea because, you know, people need help managing their money. And students are… broke? Yeah, so, uh, it’s like a way to fix that. Um, we don’t really have a demo right now, but, uh, we can show you the code if you want. Thanks.

Judge 1: Thank you. Can you explain what makes your app different from existing budgeting tools?

User: Uh, well… it’s for students? And, um, it has AI, I think. Or it will, when we add that part.

Judge 2: How does your app ensure data security for users?

User: Oh, uh, good question. We didn’t really get to that part yet. But, like, we would probably add some encryption or something later on. Yeah.

Judge 1: What specific challenges did your team face, and how did you solve them?

User: Oh, uh, a lot of stuff didn’t work. Like, the database connection was a problem, and we tried Googling it, but we didn’t really have time to fix it. So, yeah, we just kind of left it for now.

Judge 2: Do you have a plan for monetization?

User: Uh… not really. We’re still figuring that out. Maybe ads or something?

Judge 1: Alright, thank you for sharing.

User: Uh, yeah, thanks. Sorry it’s not, like, done or anything.
